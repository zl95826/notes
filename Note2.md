The general idea is that window.onload fires when the document's window is ready for presentation and document.onload fires when the DOM tree (built from the markup code within the document) is completed.\
multiplication *, division /, addition +, subtraction -. Backticks are “extended functionality” quotes. They allow us to embed variables and expressions into a string by wrapping them in ${…}.\
The word <b>“async”</b> before a function means one simple thing: a function always returns a promise. \
async/await allows us to write promise-based(asynchronous) code in a "synchronous" manner using the modern versions of Javascript. https://javascript.info/async-await \
<b>await</b>, that works only inside async functions, makes JavaScript wait until that promise settles and returns its result.\
With async/await we rarely need to write promise.then/catch, but we still shouldn’t forget that they are based on promises, because sometimes (e.g. in the outermost scope) we have to use these methods. \
<b>fetch()</b> allows you to make network requests similar to XMLHttpRequest (XHR). The main difference is that the Fetch API uses Promises, which enables a simpler and cleaner API, avoiding callback hell. \

Whenever you pass a string as an operand in a numeric/njuːˈmerɪk/ expression involving either of these operators: -, *, /, %, the number's conversion process is similar to calling the in-built Number function on the value. any string containing only numeric characters will be converted to it's number equivalent, but a string containing a non-numeric character returns NaN.\
The + operator performs two functions: Mathematical addition, String concatenation (When a string is an operand of the + operator).\
The valueOf() method returns the primitive value(string/number) of the specified object. <b>When both the toString and valueOf methods are defined on an Object, Javascript uses the valueOf method instead.</b> (toString() and valueOf(): call valueOf() first, if the result is primitive, return it and don't need to run toString; otherwise, return is not primitive, call toString.) \
The inherited toString method of Arrays work abit differently, it works in a way similar to calling the join method of an array without any arguments. Converting [] to a primitive first tries valueOf() which returns the array itself; If an object has no primitive value, valueOf returns the object itself. \
