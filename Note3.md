The JavaScript delete operator removes a property from an object; When you delete an array element, the array length is not affected. When the delete operator removes an array element, that element is no longer in the array. \
The Object.keys() method returns an array of a given object's own property names. \
Array.isArray(obj) The isArray() method determines whether an object is an array. \
The destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that unpacks values from arrays, or properties from objects, and assign into variables. It can also unpack properties from objects passed as function parameter. \
flat() returns a new array thatâ€™s a flattened version of the array it was called on. The flat() method creates a new array with all sub-array elements concatenated into it. \
const arr = [['krunal', 'ankit'], [21, 74]]; // ["krunal", "ankit", 21, 74]    \
The overflow property only works for block elements with a specified height. \
The justify-content property aligns the flexible container's items when the items do not use all available space on the main-axis (horizontally).\
justify-content: space-between; The first item is flush with the start, the last is flush with the end. There is an equal amount of space between each item. Distribute items evenly.\
The align-items property is used to align the flex items vertically.\
The <b>throw</b> statement throws (generates) a user-defined exception/error. The exception can be a JavaScript String, a Number, a Boolean or an Object. \
JavaScript has a built in <b>error</b> object that provides error information when an error occurs. The error object provides two useful properties: name and message. \
The <b>in</b> operator returns true if the specified property is in the specified object or its prototype chain. \
<b>for ... in</b>: The loop will iterate over all enumerable properties of the object itself and its constructor's prototype(it's also an object) \
If you use <b>obj.hasOwnProperty(prop)/<b> to check,  the inherited properties are not displayed.\
function.toString()/Function.prototype.toString() :The Function object overrides the toString method inherited from Object; it does not inherit Object.prototype.toString. \
obj.toString()/Object.prototype.toString(): Every object has a toString() method. The toString() method is inherited by every object descended from Object. If this method is not overridden in a custom object, toString() returns "[object type]"
