Throttling is a technique in which, no matter how many times the user fires the event, the attached function will be executed only once in a given time interval. This technique is normally used to control scrolling, resizing and mouse-related events.\
In the debouncing technique, no matter how many times the user fires the event, the attached function will be executed only after the specified time once the user stops firing the event. This technique is commonly used in search boxes with a suggest drop-down list.\
Debouncing and throttling techniques are used to limit the number of times a function can execute.
