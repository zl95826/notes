Throttling is a technique in which, no matter how many times the user fires the event, the attached function will be executed only once in a given time interval. This technique is normally used to control scrolling, resizing and mouse-related events.\
In the debouncing technique, no matter how many times the user fires the event, the attached function will be executed only after the specified time once the user stops firing the event. This technique is commonly used in search boxes with a suggest drop-down list.\
Debouncing and throttling techniques are used to limit the number of times a function can execute.\

A shallow copy successfully copies the primitive types like numbers and strings, but any object reference will not be recursively copied, but instead, the new, copied object will reference the same object. The deep copy will duplicate every object it encounters. The copy and the original object will not share anything so that it will be a copy of the original. \
The deep copy will duplicate every object it encounters. The copy and the original object will not share anything so that it will be a copy of the original. When performing a deep copy, those external objects are copied as well, so the new, cloned object is entirely independent of the old one. \
A shallow copy: It means that nested properties are still going to be copied by reference. \
